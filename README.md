To access the data from the SQL files you will need to create two .env files in your directory to access both the test and development data.

Create two .env files for your project: .env.test and .env.development. Into each, add PGDATABASE=<database_name_here>.

The database names can be found in the .sql file in the /db folder.

Please ensure these files are .gitignored.
